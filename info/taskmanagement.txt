PROBLEM 1: individual genome length are unequal

In crossoverParents function is not functioning correctly. It was first figured out when two calls to createGeneration() with multiple individuals would lead to unexpected results.

Second generation has individuals with two genes instead of three, therefore have unequal genome lengths.

Therefore, find out why new children have missing genes.


_test() function simulates generations with dummy individuals. It loops with different creations of generations N times.
